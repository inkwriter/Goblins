A choose your own adventure game, and an About page that incorporates different CSS elements and JavaScript. This site was made mobile first with a responsive design using flexbox to move the content on the About page depending on the screen size. I incorporated a hamburger menu while the site is mobile, but using CSS it shifts to a different nav bar as the screen meets the requirement of the other media queries. As for JavaScript, I added a function that caculates the possible combinations of rolling 3 six sided dice and displays the results. I also used JavaScript to hide the hamburger button menu when clicked or reveal it. It is also used to hide and display content on the Index.html page too.

This was my first attempt at CSS animations. I was inspired by Red Stapler's "Easy Realistic CSS Fire Effect".
